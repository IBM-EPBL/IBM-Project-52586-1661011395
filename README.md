SmartFarmer - IoT Enabled Smart Farming Applications


IoT-based agriculture system helps the farmer in monitoring different parameters of his field like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity using some sensors.
Farmers can monitor all the sensor parameters by using a web or mobile application even if the farmer is not near his field. Watering the crop is one of the important tasks for the farmers.
They can make the decision whether to water the crop or postpone it by monitoring the sensor parameters and controlling the motor pumps from the mobile application itself.

Project Flow:

The parameters like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are updated to the Watson IoT platform

The device will subscribe to the commands from the mobile application and control the motors accordingly

APIs are developed using Node-RED service for communicating with Mobile Application

A mobile application is developed using the MIT App inventor to monitor the sensor parameters and control the motors.

To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below:

Create and configure IBM Cloud Services

Create IBM Watson IoT Platform 

Create a device & configure the IBM IoT Platform

Create Node-RED service

Create a database in Cloudant DB to store all the sensor parameters

Develop a python script to publish and subscribe to the IBM IoT platform

Configure the Node-RED and create APIs for communicating with mobile application

Develop a mobile application to display the sensor parameters and control the motors
